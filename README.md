# DISCLAIMER
I am solely a smart contract writer/auditor. I do not promote, own, or lead projects unless specifically and explicitly stated. I am not a good trader, I know nothing of Technical Analysis, and for the most part I do not trade. Despite my best efforts, I can never guarantee full safety, though I do my best to check for and announce all risks. There are many tricks and variations that unscrupulous people can enact even with safe contracts. Please always do your research.

I am only human, and I make mistakes as well.

Nothing written in this report is financial advice. Please make sure you are interacting with the correct socials below when contacting me, to avoid scamming impersonators.

IF AN AUDIT IS NOT ON THIS PAGE OR ON MY CHANNEL, @TrynosTokenTerminal (http://t.me/TrynosTokenTerminal), THEN IT IS NOT MY AUDIT.
