All audits performed by Trynos on blockchain smart contracts.

# DISCLAIMER
I am solely a smart contract writer/auditor. I do not promote, own, or lead projects unless specifically and explicitly stated. I am not a good trader, I know nothing of Technical Analysis, and for the most part I do not trade. Despite my best efforts, I can never guarantee full safety, though I do my best to check for and announce all risks. There are many tricks and variations that unscrupulous people can enact even with safe contracts. Please always do your research.

I am only human, and I make mistakes as well.

Nothing written in this report is financial advice. Please make sure you are interacting with the correct socials below when contacting me, to avoid scamming impersonators.
